Instructions

We've already learned how to use if logic in Javascript to determine whether or not our user is running a temperature. Now, let's translate that logic in to Objective-C to see what's similar and what's different.

Submit the assignment by submitting a pull request. The steps to do that are as follows:

1. To start, fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your computer.
3. Modify the files and commit changes to complete your solution.
4. Push/sync the changes up to GitHub.
5. Create a pull request on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
